## Making a GET Request

In the case of non-text responses, you can access them in binary form using `req.content`. The module will automatically decode `gzip` and `deflate` transfer-encodings. This can be helpful when you are dealing with media files. Similarly, you can access the json-encoded content of the response, if it exists, using `req.json()`.

You can also get the raw response from the server using `req.raw`. Keep in mind that you will have to pass `stream=True` in the request to get the raw response.

Some files that you download from the internet using the Requests module may have a **huge size**. In such cases, it will not be wise to load the whole response or file in the memory at once. You can download a file in pieces or chunks using the `iter_content(chunk_size = 1, decode_unicode=False)` method.

This method iterates over the response data in `chunk_size` number of bytes at once. When `stream=True` has been set on the request, this method will avoid reading the whole file into memory at once for large responses. The chunk_size parameter can be either an integer or None. When set to an integer value, chunk_size determines the number of bytes that should be read into the memory.

When chunk_size is set to None and stream is set to True, the data will be read as it arrives in whatever size of chunks are received. When chunk_size is set to None and stream is set to False, all the data will be returned as a single chunk.

~~~python
import requests
req = requests.get('path/to/forest.jpg', stream=True)
req.raise_for_status()
with open('Forest.jpg', 'wb') as fd:
    for chunk in req.iter_content(chunk_size=50000):
        #print('Received a Chunk')
        fd.write(chunk)
~~~

## Making a POST Request

Making a POST request is just as easy as making GET requests. You just use the `post`() function instead of `get()`. This can be useful when you are automatically submitting forms. For example, the following code will download the whole Wikipedia page on Nanotechnology and save it on your PC.

~~~python
import requests
req = requests.post('https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php', data = {'search':'Nanotechnology'})
req.raise_for_status()
with open('Nanotechnology.html', 'wb') as fd:
    for chunk in req.iter_content(chunk_size=50000):
        fd.write(chunk)
~~~

## Sending Cookies and Headers

As previously mentioned, you can access the cookies and headers that the server sends back to you using `req.cookies` and `req.headers`. Requests also allows you to send your own custom cookies and headers with a request. This can be helpful when you want to, let's say, set a custom user agent for your request.

To add HTTP headers to a request, you can simply pass them in a `dict` to the `headers` parameter. Similarly, you can also send your own cookies to a server using a `dict` passed to the `cookies` parameter.

~~~python
import requests
 
url = 'http://some-domain.com/set/cookies/headers'
 
headers = {'user-agent': 'your-own-user-agent/0.0.1'}
cookies = {'visit-month': 'February'}
 
req = requests.get(url, headers=headers, cookies=cookies)
~~~

Cookies can also be passed in a Cookie Jar. They provide a more complete interface to allow you to use those cookies over multiple paths. Here is an example:

~~~python
import requests
 
jar = requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar()
jar.set('first_cookie', 'first', domain='httpbin.org', path='/cookies')
jar.set('second_cookie', 'second', domain='httpbin.org', path='/extra')
jar.set('third_cookie', 'third', domain='httpbin.org', path='/cookies')
 
url = 'http://httpbin.org/cookies'
req = requests.get(url, cookies=jar)
 
req.text
 
# returns '{ "cookies": { "first_cookie": "first", "third_cookie": "third" }}'
~~~

## Session Objects

Sometimes it is useful to preserve certain parameters across multiple requests. The Session object does exactly that. For example, it will persist cookie data across all requests made using the same session. The Session object uses urllib3's connection pooling. This means that the underlying TCP connection will be reused for all the requests made to the same host. This can significantly boost the performance. You can also use methods of the Requests object with the Session object.

Here is an example of multiple requests sent with and without using sessions:

~~~python
import requests
 
reqOne = requests.get('https://tutsplus.com/')
reqOne.cookies['_tuts_session']
#returns 'cc118d94a84f0ea37c64f14dd868a175'
 
reqTwo = requests.get('https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials')
reqTwo.cookies['_tuts_session']
#returns '3775e1f1d7f3448e25881dfc35b8a69a'
 
ssnOne = requests.Session()
ssnOne.get('https://tutsplus.com/')
ssnOne.cookies['_tuts_session']
#returns '4c3dd2f41d2362108fbb191448eab3b4'
 
reqThree = ssnOne.get('https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials')
reqThree.cookies['_tuts_session']
#returns '4c3dd2f41d2362108fbb191448eab3b4'
~~~

As you can see, the session cookie has a different value in the first and second request, but it has the same value when we used the Session object. You will be getting a different value when you try out this code, but in your case too, the cookie for the requests made using the session object will have the same value.

Sessions are also helpful when you want to send the same data across all requests. For example, if you decide to send a cookie or a user-agent header with all the requests to a given domain, you can use Session objects. Here is an example:

~~~python
import requests
 
ssn = requests.Session()
ssn.cookies.update({'visit-month': 'February'})
 
reqOne = ssn.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies')
print(reqOne.text)
# prints information about "visit-month" cookie
 
reqTwo = ssn.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies={'visit-year': '2017'})
print(reqTwo.text)
# prints information about "visit-month" and "visit-year" cookie
 
reqThree = ssn.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies')
print(reqThree.text)
# prints information about "visit-month" cookie
~~~

As you can see, the "visit-month" session cookie is sent with all three requests. However, the "visit-year" cookie is sent only during the second request. There is no mention of the "vist-year" cookie in the third request too. This confirms the fact that cookies or other data set on individual requests won't be sent with other session requests.
